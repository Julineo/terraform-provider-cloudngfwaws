# Provider cloudngfwaws

The cloudngfwaws provider provides resources to manage your Palo Alto Networks
Cloud Next-Gen Firewalls for AWS.


## Authentication Workflow

This provider first authenticates against AWS, performing STS assume role. After
that is successful, it then retrieves the JWTs for firewall and rulestack
administration.

The AWS access key and secret key can be statically specified in the `provider`
block or they will be picked up from the shared credentials file.


## Example Usage

Terraform 0.13 and later:

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf"}}


## Provider Parameter Priority

There are multiple ways to specify the provider's parameters.  If overlapping
values are configured for the provider, then this is the resolution order:

1. Statically configured in the `provider` block
2. Environment variable (where applicable)
3. Taken from the JSON config file
